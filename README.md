Kubernetes The Hard Way - Bare Metal with VM and Containers
===========================================================

# General
[This set of documents](https://github.com/cloud-helpers/cloud-helpers/kubernetes-hard-way-bare-metal/blob/master/README.md)
aim at providing full hands-on guides to set up
[Kubernetes (aka K8S)](https://kubernetes.io) clusters on bare metal servers,
which can actually be physical servers or virtual machines (VM),
on premises or in private and public clouds.

Those documents are adaptations of the excellent
["Kubernetes The Hard Way - Bare Metal"
guide](https://github.com/Praqma/LearnKubernetes/blob/master/kamran/Kubernetes-The-Hard-Way-on-BareMetal.md),
itself derived from the famous
["Kubernetes The Har Way"
guide](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way),
by [Kelsey Hightower](https://github.com/kelseyhightower).

As many other documentations, that one will soon be outdated, and imperfect
for sure. Contributions are therefore welcome to complemenent that guide.
For instance, through
[issues](https://github.com/cloud-helpers/kubernetes-hard-way-bare-metal/issues) or
[pull requests](https://github.com/cloud-helpers/kubernetes-hard-way-bare-metal/pulls).

# [With KVM/QEMU Virtual Machines (VM)](https://github.com/cloud-helpers/kubernetes-hard-way-bare-metal/blob/master/kvm-qemu/README.md)
Guide to set up a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster on
[Proxmox-based](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/features)
[KVM/QEMU virtual machines (VM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine).
Using any other
[virtualization framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualisation)
than Proxmox should not make much difference.

While full virtualization (with virtual machines) provides more flexibility
(_e.g._, choice of kernel and type of operating system, reserved CPU and
memory resources), it implies more overhead than containers.
The following section accommodates cases with more resource-conscious
requirements.

# [With LXC Containers](https://github.com/cloud-helpers/kubernetes-hard-way-bare-metal/blob/master/lxc/README.md)
Guide to set up a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster on
[Proxmox-based](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/features)
[LXC containers](https://linuxcontainers.org/#LXC).
Using [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/#LXD) or [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org)
rather than Proxmox should not make much difference.

While there are quite a few articles and solutions on Kubernetes and similar
clusters in Docker containers (_e.g._, [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io),
[Footloose](https://github.com/weaveworks/footloose)), the literature remains
scarce about Kubernetes deployed on container technologies
such as Linux containers (_e.g._, LXC, OpenVZ).
However, Linux containers allow for far more flexibility than Docker
containers. Basically, Linux containers aim at executing full-blown (Linux)
operating system (OS), whereas Docker containers aim at micro-services
and serverless platforms, mainly servicing single processes.

[This guide](https://github.com/cloud-helpers/cloud-helpers/kubernetes-hard-way-bare-metal/blob/master/lxc/README.md)
therefore aims at helping filling the gap of documentation in the
Linux container space for Kubernetes.

# [Proxmox Setup](https://github.com/cloud-helpers/kubernetes-hard-way-bare-metal/blob/master/proxmox/README.md)
That section provides some details on how to prepare a
[Proxmox distribution](https://pve.proxmox.com) in order
to setup Kubernetes clusters on it.

All the Kubernetes cluster nodes are insulated thanks to a gateway:
all the traffic from outside the cluster is channelled through the gateway.
The set up of such a gateway is also an addition to this set of guides.
It allows one to experiment with Kubernetes clusters, including operating
some in production-like settings, while keeping some good level of security.
